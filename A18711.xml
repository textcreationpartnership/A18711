         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hee was greedy of all advantages to glorifie God: if hee was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, this was his covetouſneſſe, <hi>hee coveted the beſt things.</hi> He was of a compaſſionate ſpirit, ready to doe good both to the Soules, and Bodies of others. Hee lived as lent to himſelfe, and given to others. How ſedulous he was to inſtruct the Ignorant, to reclaime the wandring, to releeve thoſe that were in want, to ſettle the unſtable ſoule, thoſe that knew him, can judge. He withſtood er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; hee was an Enemie to errour, for hee received the truth in the love of it. Hee was a Friend to truth. Hee endeavoured to comfort afflicted Conſciences, for by obſerving his owne heart, and Conference with ſuch, he attained a ſingular dexteritie this way. In his Booke you may heare him yet ſpeake, that is now dead. His Religion lay not in Tongue, but in his Heart; not in a <hi>forme of godlineſſe, but in power;</hi> as if he had learned to doe what once <hi>Minutius</hi> ſaid, <hi>Non multa loqui, ſed vivere.</hi> The ſcope, and end of this good Mans ſtudies (I ſuppoſe) in this Booke was chiefly for himſelfe, and his Familie

            <p>Againe, his friends knowing his deſire hee had to the publicke good, as alſo the favourable acceptance of his two former Bookes in the hearts of good men,<note place="margin">viz.

            <p>Reade it through before you judge, I hope you ſhall find it profitable, and abounding with much varietie; under briefe Heads drawing on the Reader to delight to ſtudie God in his Attributes, and to inlarge them in thine owne Meditation: as alſo hee repreſents God to thee in the glaſſe of the Creature, and among the rest, Man the Epitome of all; that while thou art poring after curious ſpeculations, and ſecrets of Nature, hee endeavours wiſely to divert thy thoughts, by apt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication heaven-ward.

            <p>If thou ſhalt except against any thing, conſider its a <hi>Poſthumus</hi> iſſue, then I hope you will pardon both the Author, and the Printer.</p>

Then 'tis plaine, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Men onely are the ſubjects of Admiration.</p>

We muſt not admire Poſitives, nor Comparatives, but Superlatives; things moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, things excelling. We admire things beyond our capacity, when our Reaſon can ſtretch it ſelfe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As we ſee, little children ſeeing curious workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the poore children are amazed, and admire how 'tis done, they much honour, and reverence the Artiſt that made the worke.</p>

The other, becauſe the object is ſo pure, cleare, and ſpirituall, that no ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary helpe can make it obvious.</p>

               <p>Againe, we ſee not that is farre off, and a great way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from us; as a mountaine, twenty, thirty, or forty miles, becauſe our naturall view, and proſpective view hath his bounds which we cannot exceede: all this while the defect is not in the eye, but the object is either hid, or too neeare, or too farre.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the object there is an inviſibility, which being thinne, pure, and ſpirituall, all advantages cannot make it viſible.</p>
               <p>That which makes a thing viſible is light, for in the darke wee ſee nothing; alſo it muſt be convenient light: for if the eye bee in a perfect Sunne-beam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. In the worke of Creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the worke of Redemption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his preſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the worke of Creation: <hi>In Wiſedome he made the Heavens.</hi> Pſal. 136.5. <hi>In wiſedome he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth.</hi> Prov. 3.19. <hi>In wiſedome he made all his workes.</hi> Pſal. 104.24.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:8314:43"/>
               <p>His Wiſedome appeared</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the beauty of the Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the order of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In their variety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the making of contraries, to joyne and unite one to another.</p>
               <p>The beauty of a picture, or building, doth argue the wiſedome of the Workman: the order of things argues wiſedome, when things keepe their ſtations, rankes, and places. The Sunne, Moone, and Starres keepe their owne Spheares and ſeaſons, the Sea keepes within his bankes, the beaſts and fiſhes their places appointed.</p>
               <p>The variety argues wiſedome, as if a Painter made a coſtly frame, and within it painted variety of objects; here is a pleaſant meadow, and beaſts feeding; there a Mountaine, with a flocke of ſheepe, with a Shepheard, and his dogge at the bottome; heere a chriſtall ſtreame gliding, and a flocke of Swannes ſwimming; here a man at plough, there a man a fiſhing; heere a chimney ſmoaking, there two Armies fighting; here a footman running, there a Table furniſht, and men and women feaſting; here a childe ſucking the breaſt, there a man lopping a Tree; here a Ship with full ſayles, there a Church with a Steeple, and birds flying about it: All theſe being artificially performed, and ſet out in lively colours, would both delight the ſpectator, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Actor. Even ſo the moſt wiſe God, having in ſuch variety made his workes, doth demonſtrate his aboundant wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Some creatures have matter and forme, and are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and corrupted, as mens bodies: ſome creatures have matter and forme, but are not generated, as the Sunne and Moone; their matter and forme is peculiar.</p>
               <p>Some creatures are bodies without ſpirits, as beaſts; ſome creatures are ſpirits without bodies, as Angels; ſome creatures are bodies and ſpirits united, as men; ſome
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8314:43"/> creatures are vegetives, as rootes: ſome have motion, as trees and hearbes; ſome are ſenſitive, as beaſts fowles, and fiſhes: ſome are rationall, as men.</p>
               <p>The vegetative creatures doe ſerve the ſenſitive: the ſenſitive doe ſerve the reaſonable: the variety of the creatures with their imploiments, uſes, and opperations, doe declare openly to all the unſearchable wiſedome of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, his wiſedome appeares in the worke of Redemption; in deviſing a way to redeeme us, that men and Angels could never have thought upon; in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing it by his owne way and meanes, in glorifying his attributes in that worke; his goodneſſe ſent Chriſt, his power ſupported him; way was made for his mercy, ſatisfaction was given to his juſtice; his love was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, his truth was ſealed, his immutableneſſe was proved, his holineſſe proclaimed, his excellencies were made knowne to us in his ſonne: he that could in one work accompliſh this, muſt needs be wiſe, yea, wiſedome it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, his wiſedome appeares in the worke of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Firſt, in preſerving all creatures; Secondly, in giving each creature fit nouriſhment: Thirdly, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of contraries to uphold the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In preſerving all the creatures; 'tis greate wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to preſerve a few; but ſuch great variety of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as God preſerves in heaven, earth, and Sea, argues infinite wiſedome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He gives to each Creature fit nouriſhment; he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and preſerves the earth with raine, and the Sunne: he preſerveth ſheep with graſſe, men with bread, babes with milke.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He makes contraries to preſerve the whole: thunder and tempeſts doe cleare the aire: the ſelling of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> preſerved the Church; the crucifying of Chriſt ſaves our ſoules. Our bodies are compounded of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8314:44"/> foure contrary elements, yet all doe concurre for our being, and well-being; the good and bad are mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the badd doe exerciſe the good: the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the bad, both are uſefull one to the other: theſe contraries God makes to concurre together, ſo the world is preſerved.</p>
               <p>Here it matter for admiration, demonſtration, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, conſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, here is matter for admiration: <hi>Oh the deepneſſe and riches of the wiſedome of God.</hi> Rom. 11.33. His wiſedome is uncreate and perfect, not attained by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obſervation, or experience, or events; but it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, and effectuall, and worthy of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; eſpecially wee ſhould admire the worke of our Redemption, accompliſht by Chriſt, (the wiſedome of the father) which the Angels deſire to behold.</p>
               <p>His Wiſedome appoynted ſuch a Redeemer, as was begotten of the fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this demonſtrates their wretchedneſſe, that are enemies to the Church and people of God, though they are very wiſe, and take crafty councell together, yet they ſhall fall, for they have the moſt wiſe God againſt them, who will catch them in their owne craftineſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. and turne their councell to fooliſhneſſe. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31. Alſo this demonſtrates the happineſſe of the godly, they have the moſt wiſe teacher, <hi>Iob</hi> 36.22. no teacher is like to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He not onely teacheth and gives rules, but alſo gives power and ability to keepe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He never doth erre in his teaching.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He rewards his ſchollers with eternall rewards.</p>
               <p n="4">4. None of his ſchollers can ever excell him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He ever lives to teach one generation after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No teacher is like him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, heare is matter of exhortation, to goe to God
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8314:44"/> for wiſedome, it is he that gives it: <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the diligent which prevaile with him the moſt; therefore wee ſhould cry for wiſedome and call for underſtanding, and take great paines for it, as men doe, that dig and ſearch in the bowels of the earth for ſilver and gold. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, here is aboundance of conſolation for them that are in favour with God; his wiſedome is for them, to direct them in afflictions, temptations, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In affliction his wiſedome teacheth them to looke to his hand and providence, to ſubmit, to repent, to pray, to be more humble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In tentation his wiſedome teaches them to diſcerne a tentation, to ſtruggle, and to cry to him for helpe, to take the ſword of the ſpirit, which is, the word of God; to forbeare ſomething, to deny themſelves, to reſiſt, to looke to the reward promiſed to thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In proſperity his wiſedome keepes them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt deadly, though they are corrupted dangerouſly: his wiſedome tempers their proſperity with ſome loſſes, or ſickneſſes, or outward moleſtations, or elſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſedneſſe to good troubles them, or Sathan is let looſe to buffet them; or God affects them, and makes them ſenſible of other calamities, to ſympathize, and condo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e with them; or God gives them aboundance of grace and heavenly ſweetneſſe, that ſo their proſperity may not be to their ruine, nor they clogged with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, his wiſedome is ſo profound, that hee can turne poyſon into phyſicke, and our maladies into medicines; he can turne our ſinnes and corruptions to an advantage, of that dung he can make ſoyle, to cauſe us to be more fertile; our very ſinnes, when wee are inſtructed by the Lord, doe make us the more humble
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8314:45"/> and broken in heart, and poore in ſpirit: we doe ſee our neede of Chriſt to ſave us, and to prize him above 10000 worlds: we do pray more earneſtly, and watch, and ſtrive, and long for heaven, and beare with others the more, knowing our owne guiltineſſe, and feeeling our owne infirmities.</p>

               <p>In buying are three things: firſt, we ſee our need: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee goe where the commodity is to be had: thirdly, we give ſomething for it by way of exchange.</p>
               <p>Thus we muſt buy the Truth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt ſee our need of it; without the Truth we are in bondage, and in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, and miſerable. The Truth will make us free ſet us at liberty, give us light and life; it will direct us, and enrich us; theſe conſiderations ſhould cauſe us to prize it, becauſe it is of worth, and we neede it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt goe where it is to be had, not to the Iewiſh <hi>Talmud,</hi> nor Turkes <hi>Alcoran,</hi> nor the Papiſts <hi>Legend;</hi> but got to God who gives it, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Truth; goe to the holy <hi>Bible,</hi> where 'tis prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; to the congregations where 'tis preached, unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and applied: goe to the ſociety of the godly, where it is profeſſed, and the power of it expreſſed; read Commentaries and Expoſitions, labour, and enquire; digge, and ſearch, be ſtudious, and induſtrious; let ſpare
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8314:47"/> houres here be ſpent, and vacant time be this way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt part with ſomething for the Truth; wee muſt part with ſome ſleepe, with ſome pleaſure, with ſome gaine; nay, if we part with all that we have for the Truth, we ſhall be wiſe bayers, and great gainers; we ſhall be wiſe Merchants, and obtaine the beſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Truth is to be bought, ſo it is to be kept, with <hi>Mary, to lay it up in our hearts.</hi> Iohn 2.51. Pſal. 119.10. The Word is kept by witneſſing to it, <hi>John</hi> 18.37. and by profeſſing it: for by profeſſing it the Truth is knowne, and ſpread abroad in the world.</p>
               <p>We ſhould witneſſe in our profeſſion three things of the Truth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is able to worke a through change<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 1.18.</note>, and to bring a man to a holy frame of heart and life<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 17.17.</note>, that the Word hath a regenerating power to make us new men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Truth hath a power to governe and guide a man in his place, to make him a good Father, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; a good ſervant, a loyall ſubject, a loving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a kinde neighbour, a faithfull friend, a mercifull Chriſtian, a juſt dealer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Truth is able to ſupport him in reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, under croſſes, and troubles; that there are conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be had in the Scriptures for every condition, in all changes, and alterations.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhall we ſhew our ſelves children of the Truth, begotten by the Truth, <hi>James</hi> 1.18. Nouriſhed by the Truth, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.

               <p>IUſtice is to give to every one his owne; it is to doe right, to keepe equity: Juſtice is either diſtributive in dealing, ſo 'tis communicative juſtice; or diſtributive in puniſhing, ſo it is corrective juſtice.</p>
               <p>Juſtice is to give neither too much, nor too little; it is to be exact, as a man that ſhootes, which neither ſhoots over the marke, nor ſhort of it, nor beſides it, but hits it juſt in the middle.</p>

               <p>IUſtice in men, is either juſtice before men, or juſtice before God: Juſtice before men the heathen attaine, to pay that they owe, not to wrong their neighbour in dealing: A heathen buyes a commodity of a Chriſtian merchant, and going away, opens his wares and findes money, he brings it backe to the Chriſtian, and ſaith, I bought the wares, not the money, 'tis unjuſt to me to keepe it. Juſtice before God is legall or Evangelicall: Legally juſt was never any, but <hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie, and Chriſt, that juſt one, who fulfilled all righteouſnes.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8314:51"/> Evangelicall juſtice is that, when a ſinner being juſtified by imputation of Chriſts juſtice, labours for inherent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by the vertue of the regenerating ſpirit in him, the indeavouring after juſtice is called juſtice through Gods acceptation.</p>

A man that lives to God, would not change the condition thereof with a worldly man, though he were a Lord, or Prince. This life of grace is a life of knowledge, which doth change him: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. A life of joy, which

                  <p n="2">2. The life of grace is moſt honourable: Two things doe bring honour, one, to doe that is hard; the other, to doe that which is profitable. Hee that lives a life of grace, doth hard things; he ſubdues himſelfe, workes out his ſalvation, increaſes dayly his aſſurance, edifies his brethren, and in this imployment is honourable.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What Hatred is.</head>
               <p>IT is a diſliking, deteſting, and avoiding things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to us, to our nature, liking, and welfare. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is of things contrary to us; as God hates ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to
<list>
                     <item>1. His Nature.</item>
                     <item>2. His Law.</item>
                     <item>3. His Honour.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Man hates contrary to fight and feeling, as ſtripes, and torments, and death, and ſickneſſe, contrary to our being, or wel-being. So then Hatred is a diſliking, a deſire of ſeparation, a deteſting, a flying off that which we apprehend to be againſt us, and our good.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the diſtinctions of Hatred in perſons.</head>
               <p>IN God 'tis moſt pure and holy: what hee doth, is good; his will is the rule of righteouſneſſe: nothing is in him, or that proceeds from him, but that is moſt righteous, holy, and good.</p>
               <p>Hatred in man is ſometimes a lawfull affection,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8314:61"/> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Yee that love the Lord, hate evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, there is hatred cauſleſſe; as ſome hate cheeſe, ſome hate ſome fruites which in themſelves are lovely; but the contrariety and hatred is in their natures: this is in vegetables in beaſts, &amp; in fowles, and fiſhes, as between the Vine and the Colewort, betweene the Serpent and the Spider, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So men of accurſed natures, hate God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. hate Light, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. hate good men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. hate goodneſſe without juſt cauſe, as <hi>Caine</hi> hated <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is a cauſe makes men hate; as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren hated him, becauſe they thought his fathers love would be removed from them to him.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Ahab</hi> hated <hi>Michaiah</hi> becauſe he reproved him: ſo the Dove hates the Hawke, and the Lambe the wolfe, becauſe they know them their enemies, and come to devoure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is hatred of enmity, when we hate the evill, and the party, wiſhing him puniſhment or death: ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill men doe hate ſuperiors puniſhing. And there is an hatred of abhomination, when wee, loving our ſelves or others, hate thoſe evils of ſinne or puniſhment that may be hurtfull to us or them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As there is a diſtinction in perſons or cauſes, ſo in things: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. Envy and hatred differ in the kind; hatred is in a kind in other creatures, envy is onely humane.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Envy ariſes from ſome good befalne to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, hatred from ſome ill he doth to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We hate Toads and Serpents, but envy not beaſts for ſtrength, ſwiftneſſe, or beauty; onely we envy men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some hatred is lawfull; but no envy is lawfull.</p>
               <p>So there is a difference betweene hatred and anger.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hatred reaches to many, but anger to few moſt uſually.</p>
               <p>Anger, the older it growes, the weaker it is: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8314:61"/> the older it growes, the ſtronger it is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The angry man would have the party hee is angry with, to know he is angry: but he that hates, conceales his hatred often times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Anger ceaſes, if we ſee miſery with ſubmiſſion; but hatred is often cruell and brutiſh, and unſatisfied, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it ſee the ruine of the party.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Anger is more painefull for the preſent, becauſe of vehemency: but hatred is more quiet, yet doth watch an opportunity.</p>
               <p>There is a diſtinction of degrees: there is diſlike, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and abhorring; diſlike breedes hatred, and hatred growes to an abhorring, to a deadly hate.</p>

               <p n="1">1. TO admire the love of God: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1. both for the freeneſſe, greatneſſe, and continuance: we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that we cannot comprehend; ſuch is the love of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. that it paſſes our knowledge.</p>

Let us bee wiſe, and in the ſunne-ſhine of his patience procure our owne peace, get aſſurance of his favour, that Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience may be prolonged, our wiſedome commended, and our happineſſe eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Admire Gods patience, he came to <hi>Adam</hi> at the coole of the day, ſhewing his patience: He ſpared the old world 120 yeares, hee hath ſpared us a long time.</p>

               <p>Are we troubled in mind? we muſt be patient, and wait.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Here ſee the miſery of the impatient; they are as ſouldiers without armor, as travellers without ſhooes, ſtil they are wounded and pricked: every word makes them take exception, and every ſmall croſſe becomes heavy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Their ignorance and pride workes them more woe than all their miſeries, and they vexe themſelves more than their enemies can doe. A glaſſe, or a knife broke, or their dogge kicked, or a ſcoffe caſt on them, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them, and they are in their mindes in an uproare like the Beare-garden: they are like a ſore, ever aking, and muſt not be touched: they are unfit for the Croſſe, and farre from conſolation: they cannot enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are miſerable whereſoever they are; alwaies in danger to be baited with the Croſſe, and meete with vexations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Here we may try our ſelves whether we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained patience. Hath the head aked? or the childe died? or the Cuſtomer broke? or the ſervant proved falſe? hath ſome cenſured, or falſly accuſed us? have friends proved perfidious? is trading decayed? how doe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves? doe we vexe, and fret, and looke to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes, complain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, we ſhould endeavour to doe Gods will.</p>
               <p>We attaine the knowledge of Gods will,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By getting into the eſtate of grace, and being beleevers: for knowledge is a peculiar gift to ſuch. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. The Divell blindes unbeleevers. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. The booke is cloſed to them. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28.11. or if it be opened, they have not judgement. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. We underſtand by bookes: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. Therefore we ſhould ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. there is the fountaine of ſaving knowledge, there we ſhould labour hard. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wee muſt frequent the faithfull miniſtry of the word, there we ſhall be fed with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:8314:73"/>5. Be ſure prayer be not omitted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. wee muſt cry for knowledge, and call for underſtanding. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2, 3. pray earneſtly for the Spirit promiſed. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. that Spirit is the Spirit of revelation. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We muſt labour to be ſuch veſſels as knowledge is put into, and get theſe qualifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To feare God; <hi>for his ſecrets are revealed to them that feare him. Pſal.</hi> 25 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To obey him, then we ſhal know. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To give up our ſelves wholly to his ſervice, and to be at his diſpoſing; then wee ſhall know what is his good and acceptable will. <hi>Rom</hi> 12.2.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We ſhould propound our doubts to them able to reſolve us: the Diſciples gained knowledge by queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with our Saviour apart: alſo Expoſitors, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, Dictionaries are helpes, and as buckets where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we draw waters out of the Well of knowledge.</p>
               <p>We ſhould doe the will of God:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe then we ſhall differ from Hypocrites, which ſpeake that is good, but doe it not. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhall be like the Angels, which execute the will of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3, We ſhall be the children of wiſedome, and differ from fooles: hee that hears, and doth, is as a wiſe builder that built on a rocke. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſhall be honourable, being in affinity to Chriſt: thoſe that doe his will, he accounts as his kindred. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.50.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſhall be under the promiſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, temporall, <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 1.19. <hi>If yee conſent and obey, yee ſhall eate the good things of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſpirituall; <hi>The Spirit is promiſed to them that aske, but is given to them that obey.</hi> Acts 5.32.</p>
               <p>The eternall promiſe is made to the obedient, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. He ſhall enter into heaven that doth the will of God. <hi>Romans</hi> 2.7. Heaven is for them that by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8314:74"/> doe continue in well-doing.</p>
               <p>The manner of doing Gods Will.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be done ſpeedily: muſt and haſte is for the great King. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>I made haſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be done ſincerely, looking to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and preſence, and reward. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>God loves truth in the inward parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt be done conſtantly; for the former part of our life yeelds to the latter: If we doe leave our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, it was but ſeeming righteouſneſſe, and wee ſhall periſh in wickedneſſe. <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.24. Againe, it is an indignity to the Lord to leave his ſervice; and laſtly, we loſe the promiſe which is made to perſeverance. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Gods Will muſt be done cheerefully; for we ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſinne with great delight: God is the better Maſter, his worke and wages more honourable. Secondly, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe will evidence us to be Gods people, who are a willing people. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Thirdly, God accepts the will without the worke, as in <hi>Abraham</hi> offering <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but never the worke without the will. Fourthly, cheerefulneſſe is acceptable, like ripe fruite ſoone ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, pleaſant to the eye and taſte. Fifthly, uncheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a diabolicall ſervice, a beaſtly ſervice; we make them obey with whips, goads, and ſpurres. Sixthly, there is a ſpeciall command of cheerefulneſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.14 and a fearefull threat againſt uncheerefulneſſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48.</p>

Miſerable is the condition of all naturall men which are not reconciled to the Lord of Hoaſts: hee the ſoveraigne Lord is againſt them, they may feare he will ſend one of his hoaſt to puniſh them: they may feare the fire will deſtroy them, the water drowne them, a beaſt goare them, their meate choake them, the tile-ſtone kill them, the iron weapon ſlay them, and all creatures warre againſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhould admire his wiſedome that orders the multitudes of his armies, and cauſes them to keepe their appoynted places, and imployes them for their ſeverall uſes.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How men doe make God an Idoll.</head>
               <p>TIs impoſſible to turne the eſſence of God to an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll, but men are ſaid to make God an Idoll in imagination, and in converſation; in imagination, that conceive of God to be like an Idoll, that thinke God will doe neither good nor evill: that God ſees not, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.7. they could conceive no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of an Idoll.</p>
               <p>Men make God an Idoll in his worſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they prepare not their hearts, nor fit their affections for his preſence; they could doe no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, were they to come before an Idoll that could take no notice of their hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When all their religion is in the Temple, there they leave their God: if they ſerved an Idoll in the Temple he could not ſee their behaviour in their houſes, nor have they communion with him at home, theſe men carry themſelves as if God were an Idoll, only ſetled within the walls of the Temple. This is indeed the principall, but not the ſole place of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When men invent wayes to worſhip God: and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne devices and imaginations, they make God like an Idoll which cannot direct his worſhippers, but they will teach him how he muſt be ſerved; they could doe no more to an Idoll.</p>
               <p>In converſation men make God an Idoll.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they ſay it is in vaine to ſerve God, and to walke humbly before him: that thinke God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his ſervants, they could thinke or ſay no more of an Idoll, which receives all and gives nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:8314:84"/>2. When men commit horrible ſins in ſecret, were God an Idoll they could doe no more, as if he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call them to a reckoning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That oppoſes the godly and perſecutes them: were God an Idoll then they might trouble his ſervants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or danger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When men ſcrape together aboundance of wealth by wicked meanes, then on their ſicke bed they thinke by ſome dead workes to ſatisfie for all; as if God were an Idoll that for a few ſcraps of that is evilly gotten, would be dumbe for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When men forſweare themſelves and call God to witneſſe to a lye: were he an Idoll that could not ſee their abomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. GOD hath a baſe eſteeme of them, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. thoſe which deſpiſe him ſhall be deſpiſed, they ſhall find him no Idoll but a living God, when they fall into his hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and a ſeeing God when he ſets their ſins in order before them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They thinke he ſees not; he puniſhes them with blindneſſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. ſo they have eyes and ſee not, they come to his worſhip with no more preparation, then to come before an Idoll; and goe away with no more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then if they had bin before an Idoll.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They will bring in humane inventions into his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and preſcribe rules out of their owne braine, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects all their ſervices, and makes them looſe all their coſt and paines, and tells them their worſhip is vaine, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſinne freely as if he were an Idoll; God lets them alone, throwes the raines on their necks, ſo they

               <p>We looke on it not ſo much with an eye aſcending as deſcending, by a baſon or pot of water men uſe to looke upon it.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, there are degrees of light, ſo there are degrees of Grace: at firſt converſion we are as the morning-light, partly darke, and partly light: <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. thus we are light as the morning: then we proceed to bee faire, as the moone. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, inferiority is not an annihilation; the Moone is a light, though inferiour to the Sunne: I muſt not cenſure my ſelfe to be no Chriſtian, becauſe I am of an inferiour ranke; a man may be a free-man, yet not an Alderman; a Souldier, yet no Captaine; the foote is of the body, though not ſo honourable as the hand. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be thankfull for the gifts beſtowed on me, and to be contented with my owne condition, and with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to looke on them; excell me in ſtriving againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, inferiors doe make their ſuperiors to appeare more honourable the light of the Sun is the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous being compared with the moone: The people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Saul,</hi> made his talleneſſe and height to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8314:103"/> more obvious, The ſpies were as graſhoppers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſonnes of <hi>Anaak:</hi> my littleneſſe doth honour my ſuperiours greatneſſe, my government of my family honors the Kings government of whole Realmes: my teaching of my family honors my preacher, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches a whole congregation: Thus honoring my ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in judgement and practice, they will ſhine on me with protection and doctrine, and my littleneſſe makes their greatneſſe appeare, and I give them honour for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Inferiour things are not to be deſpiſed, the Moone though an inferiour light is not deſpiſed: but of men deſired, ſome are little ones, but muſt not be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. men may have inferiour gifts yet honeſt hearts; I muſt love them for their ſincerity, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them for their inferiority. <hi>Benaiah</hi> was honorable though he attained not to the firſt three, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.23. I deſire to honour all Chriſtians, and not to deſpiſe the leaſt of them, and ſo to reverence great ones which doe beare Gods Image, that I may not deſpiſe little ones as though they had none of his Image.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, there is variety in Gods workes, inferiour and ſuperiour argues variety, and variety argues wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. There is variety of parts in my ſelfe, there is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of faculties and members in me: In heaven, earth, and ſeas, there is variety, to fill me with delight, to raiſe me to meditation, to teach me to admire and ſay, O Lord how wonderfull are thy workes, in wiſedome haſte thou made them all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The brightneſſe of the Moone is uſefull and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>Things are beautifull in their ſeaſon, water to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and the Moone in the night, I may learne from the Moone to be uſefull, ſeaſonably, and to take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities offered me to doe good in them: to give and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, to beare and forbeare, to ſpeake and to bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,

               <p>Thirdly, the Moone diſcovers onely groſſe things.</p>
               <p>The eſtate of nature is as the Moone-light, the eſtate of grace is as the Sunne-light: of wicked men it may be ſaid: <hi>Neſcierunt neque intellexerunt,</hi> they know not,<note place="margin">Pſalme 82.5.</note> nor underſtand, but of the godly we may ſay, Bleſſed are your eyes, for you ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16. The Moone light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers houſes, trees, and beaſts. The light of the Sun diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers in his beames the ſmalleſt moates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſiderations from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I muſt labour to get out of a naturall condition, and I muſt pray for that bleſſed ſpirit of God which doth convince; that ſeeing my miſery, I may relliſh the mercy of God, O how ſweet is mercy to a ſelfe condemning broken hearted ſinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this I know God hath given me a better light then my owne, which I have by nature; I once thought that if I abſtained from groſſe ſinnes; (made knowne to me) as blaſphemy, murther, adultery, theft, &amp;c. it was a great matter, but being farther convinced, I ſee idle thoughts and idle words to be offenſive evills, I ſee that omiſſions of good duties is dangerous, and am troubled not onely for my ill diſpoſition, but for my indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, want of zeale for God, want of ſorrow for other mens ſinnes, not ſhunning the occaſions of ſinne, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets me ſince the Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on my horizon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe which cannot ſee trees, nor houſes, nor mountaines, have not ſo much as Moone light, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſo darke in the aire, that men cannot ſee their hand held up before them. Some men want the light of grace, and of nature, and reaſon, theſe men are darkneſſe <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. and walke in darkneſſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.12. and their wages is <hi>(in Tenebras exteriores)</hi> it utter darkeneſſe,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8314:104"/> from the eſtate of darkneſſe, the worke of darkneſſe, and the wages of darkneſſe, O Lord deliver my ſoule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the nearer the Moone is to the Sunne, it is darker to the earth.</p>
               <p>The Moone being nearer, the Sunne is the brighter above, but darker beneath: So the nearer my ſoule is to God, the more it is bright upward, and of a heavenly diſpoſition: God ſhining on mee my glory is reall, though inviſible to others: my light and life being with God, men may looke on me, as one not to bee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without forme or beauty: ſo they looked on my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2. to ſome he was vailed, yet to ſome hee was revealed: So it is with Chriſtians, the world ſees their infirmities and afflictions, but there is a bright ſide they ſee not;<note place="margin">Exod. 25.5.</note> there is a curious Arke, though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Badgers skinnes: the world ſees the blacke ſide, but not the beſt ſide; they cannot ſee inviſible things, till they have obtained faith. Let me bee light to God, though darke to the world: when God ſhines on me, then am I bright upward, and then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his light as the drop doth the Ocean.</p>
               <p>The Moone more remote from the Sunne, is bright downeward; ſo the leſſe portion of grace, and the more remote from God, the more welcome to the world: It is my Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> though prophane; and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> are ſeene with great Pompe, <hi>Abſolom</hi> and his foote-men, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> and his Captaines, and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, <hi>Herod</hi> and his royall aparrell have terrene glory; yet theſe are remote from the Sunne of righteouſneſſe: Oh that I could neglect that ſplendor is had, with a neglect of communion with God: Let mee never bee ſo ſhining toward the earth, that I may bee darke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven: Let me not flatter for favour, nor feare contempt; but let me draw neare to God, that he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neare to me, the raies of his light ſhining on me, ſhal make me both honourable and ſatisfied.</p>

How good is God that makes the Aire ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; the poore Plough-man hath a better portion in it, than the rich Citizen: The Aire is Gods doale to the world, all ſhare in it; the dogge, the horſe, the ſwine are not deprived of it: yet it is more pretious than the gold of Ophir: the Rubies and Pearles are not to be compared with it: were it not to bee had without price, a man would part with all his ſubſtance for it, and purchaſe it with his chiefeſt treaſure; yet God in bounty makes it common, and more plentifull than the ſtones of the ſtreet: O bleſſe his name for ever.</p>

God takes not away this uſeful Creature, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues it, I muſt learne of him not to take away from men that which is moſt uſefull, that which they cannot well bee without: To take a poore mans tooles to pawne, or his bed-cloathes or garments, and keep them, is ſomwhat harſh: To with-draw maintenance from my teacher, to take away the good name of my brethren, to be a meanes to keepe bread from the Market, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching from the people, is not the Divine, but the diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call nature.</p>

               <p>A Meteor is taken more largely, or more ſtrictly. Largely, all vapours, exhalations, clouds, windes, tempeſts, haile, ſnow, are Meteors: <hi>Meteora</hi> is, firſt, things ingendred. Secondly, in the aire. Thirdly, unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect things ingendred imperfectly in the aire: ſtrictly, it is either from vapours ariſing from the water, or exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from the earth, or both; ſo growing hard and clammy, are called Meteors in the aire.</p>

               <p>They are not of fire, nor of aire, and ſo are of unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mixture: for the perfect bodies are either ſimple, compounded of the foure elements. The Meteors are not of fire, for the fire conſumes them, and doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them: the fire, (I meane the elementary fire) is ſo thinne, it cannot be altered and made thinner: if the fire
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8314:143"/> were thicker, it would become hot aire: neither are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors made of aire: for if aire were made thinner, it would turne to fire: the exhalation then is not from aire nor fire.</p>

               <p>Meteors have their production from the Waters and Earth: from the waters do ariſe moyſt vapors, from the Earth ariſe exhalations more hot and dry, and are more thin, and pierce the Ayre, aſcending up more free then Vapors to the place where they are fired and conſumed, and tis probable that Meteors are rather exhalations then Vapors. As there be ſeene ſome at Sea: it may be they ariſe from vapors, or from ſome Iſles of the Sea; or exhalations may be drawne from Fleetes of ſhips, and great Navies, this is but conjectures, wee muſt leave many cauſes in nature, to the God of Nature, who onely knowes them.</p>

               <p>NOt in the heate of Summer, for then the Sunne is ſtrong on the earth in his heate, and conſumes the matter whereof the Meteors are formed. Not in the deepe of Winter, for then the Sunne is ſo farre diſtant, that tis not ſo operative to raiſe the exhalations up into the Ayre. But the Spring and Autumne is the ordinary time. As for the Star that did lead to Chriſt in the deep of winter, it may be the Countrey is temperate, or it was an extraordinary Meteor or Starre for ſpeciall uſe. God can throw the reines on natures necke, yet keepes the bridle in his mouth; hee can worke by ſecondary meanes, and without them.</p>

And to proove that great quantity is exhaled up in the Meteor, it appeares in ſome Comets or blazing Stars, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue many dayes after they be fired, before they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, which argues there was a great quantity that laſted ſo long.</p>

The place of their production is not farre North, for that is too cold: nor yet in the South, for there the Sun beames are too hot; but that part of the earth which is like the Spring and Autumne, all the yeare there are moſt Meteors: Vnder the Equinoctial line are none, nor in the two extreames, but in the temperate Climat there they ariſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The place whither they aſcend, tis to the upper Region, for the middle Region wanting the reflexion of the Sunne beames, is extreame cold. In the lower Region is Froſts and Miſts, in the middle Region, Clouds and raine, in the upper Region Comets and blazing ſtars.</p>

               <p>An Hypocrite is like unto a Meteor. Firſt, a Meteor is rayſed from the Earth, yet is not earth: So an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is rayſed in the Church, yet is not of the Church: <hi>They went out from vs, ſaith</hi> St. Iohn, <hi>but are not of us;</hi> he is not of the true Church of Chriſts myſticall body.</p>

The Soule actes, and flieth beyond the power of our ſences: It flies from Eaſt to Weſt ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; It paſſes over the Seas, it calculates the courſe of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres. The Soule diſcourſeth of things paſt, and foreſeeth things to come: In hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Soule firſt doubteth, then deliberates, then chooſeth, the Soule paſſeth through humane actions; defining, dividing, compounding, diſſolving: the Soule pearceth the skies, and conceaves of GOD, and of his Angels to be immortall Eſſences, thus the Soule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaves of immortall things, ſtrives for immortall rewards, feares immortall puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The vigor, ſtrength, and duration of the Soule proves it immortall, age, and ſickneſſe doe weaken the body; yet the Soule hath life and vigour, the Soule wantes manifeſtation: in children old-men, and mad-men, drunken-men, and men a ſleepe: the Sunne is the ſame though the clouds doe hinder the ſhining, the Soule is the ſame, and as an able work-man, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments be weake or out of order, or broken.</p>

               <p>Secondly, how tis manifeſted:</p>

               <p>Thirdly, how ſpirituall life is preſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By a good diet, we muſt ſtrive for appetite, and for food: labour, and ſalt things, and ſharp things brings appetite: we muſt exerciſe our ſelves in the Law, and applie the curſes and the threatnings home to the ſoule; this will make us to hunger for <hi>Christ,</hi> for mercie, and grace: then labour for nouriſhment; the word preacht and reade, the Sacraments, and prayer, and conference, and meditation are ſpirituall nouriſhments to preſerve ſpirituall life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Life is preſerved by exerciſe, we ſhould put forth our habilities in duties, as in Gods ſight, and for

               <p n="1">1. There is preventing Phyſique, to remember Gods Preſence, Gods Law, the great accompt, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we enioy, the example of <hi>Christ;</hi> theſe meanes keeps us from ſinfull diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There purging Phyſique, true ſorrow, free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, humiliation, prayer, turning to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>In the third place, as there is a life of Nature, and a life of Grace; ſo there is for the ſoule a life of Glorie.</p>

                  <item>4. The ſignes of death.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, what death is, <hi>Plinie</hi> calles it ruine. <hi>Horace,</hi> the laſt line of things. Some call death a diſſolution or departing: ſometimes tis afflictions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death:</hi> ſometimes tis a dangerous thing, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.40. <hi>Death is in the pot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death is the ſeparating the Soule from the body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27 our living out of Gods favour, and without the Word of God, is the ſhadow of death. The ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Soule from the body, is bodily death: the ſeparation of grace from the Soule, is ſpirituall death: the ſeparation of the Soule, and body from God and Glorie is eternall death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how the Soule can be ſaid to dye: It dyeth not in reſpect of exiſtence, and being; but relatively, in reſpect of Gods Grace and favour, as the body being dead, there is eares, and eyes, and handes, and feete; but without life, ſo it is a carkaſſe, till life be put into it, being voide of motion: ſo the Soule hath underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, memorie, will, and affections; yet is dead by Nature, having no ſpirituall motion, hence tis ſaid, <hi>Men are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes;</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. <hi>Let the dead burie their dead,</hi> Matth. 8.22. <hi>This thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dead,</hi> Luke 15.31. <hi>She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the cauſe of death is ſinne, there was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, lively eſtate in mans innocencie: Death was threatned as a puniſhment, and was accompliſhed when man had ſinned: <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood or fell for himſelfe, and his Poſteritie, as <hi>Levie</hi> paid <hi>Tithes</hi> in <hi>Abraham: Heb.</hi> 7.9. So we ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> being in his loines, ſo death went over all men in aſmuch as all men have ſinned, <hi>Romans</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſignes and markes of death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where a dead body is there in time, is rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8314:154"/> ſo tis with the dead ſoule, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 53.3. <hi>All are corrupted,</hi> that is loathſome and ſtinking: <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Where death is, there is inſenſibleneſſe: So the Soules, dead in ſinne are paſt feeling, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. They are ſo ſenſles, they feele nothing, though the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth be remooved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.5. They in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger be, as the drunkard aſleepe on the top of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Where men are dead, they feede not; preſent to them the daintieſt diſh, they taſte not of it: ſo men that are dead in ſinne, feede not on <hi>Christ</hi> the heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> nor on the word, the foode of their Soules, if wiſedome make her feaſt, and prepare her dainties, the living are her gueſtes, the dead in ſinne heare not her invitations, not come to her houſe, nor eate with her at her table.</p>

               <p>THE Naturall cauſe is from the ſpirits comming from the Optick Nerves, into the Apple of the Eie, wherein there is a Cryſtalline humour, which receives, as by a mirrour, the kindes of colours, and the figures, numbers, motions of bodies: The Nerves of the Eie are ſeated betweene the place of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: there is a meeting like the forke of a tree, and the ſpirits meete together, ſo the Obiect is one: otherwaies all things would ſeeme double to us: <hi>Anatomists</hi> ſay, there are ſix inner parts of the Eie.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8314:162"/>1. The Fat which is placed above the Eie, for to defend it from cold, to keepe it from the hardneſſe of the bone, and to fill up the diſtance of muſcles, to further the quick motion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Glandule is ſeated in the upper part of the Outer Corner, lodged in the Fat, and full of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, to helpe the Nimble motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Nerves, being in Number ſix; whereof foure be ſtraight, and two Oblique, or winding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Tunicles are ſix in number: The firſt, <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata membrana:</hi> the utmoſt pannicle which cleaves to the Eie, and makes it firme: The ſecond is <hi>Cornea;</hi> tis firme, and bright: The third is <hi>Vvea;</hi> which ſome count the fourth thinne Membrane, wee ſee our ſelves in the Apple of ones Eie, from the hole of <hi>Vvea:</hi> The fourth is <hi>Membrana Pupillaris,</hi> the membranous Circle compaſſing the Ball, or Apple of the Eie: The fift, a <hi>Criſtalline humour:</hi> The ſixt, <hi>like a ſpiders web.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Humours. There is firſt the watrie humour: ſecondly, a cryſtallick humour: the third, is like moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten glaſſe; exceeding the other two in quantitie.</p>

               <p>And now I come to heare what the Word of GOD ſaith: The Lord hath made the Eie to ſee: <hi>He formed the Eie,</hi> Pſalme 94.9.

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8314:163"/>
               <head>Concluſions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. As the Lord gives Eies, ſo he gives light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, our Eies would be unprofitable: for in the darke, wee ſee nothing. GOD hath not made my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as a faire building without windowes.

               <p n="2">2. If the Lord give Eies, and Sight: let mee take heed, I abuſe not that Bleſſing, and deprive my ſelfe of it, by late working to get money; or, by late ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I may weaken my Sight; by drinking exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I may bring redneſſe, and Reumes; and by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and quarrelling, I may looſe an Eie, as ſome have done to their griefe.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>THE Benefits may be rancked to two Heads: Safetie, and Comfort: Firſt, Safetie: by our Eyes wee ſee dangers at Sea, afarre off, by a proſpective glaſſe, Pirates are diſcovered; and enemies, that way, are in ſome places, and times diſcovered at Land. By the Eie we ſee a ſtorme, and ſhelter our ſelves, if wee can: we ſee what is hurtfull in our meates, our houſes, our Cartell: and ſome of the wiſer ſort of women, doe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8314:163"/> ſee by their husbands lookes, they beginne to be angrie, and ſo give them good words, or els, be ſilent, or avoid their preſence for a time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Comforts by the Eies are Profits, or Delights:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Profit is great: all Arts, and Sciences are learned by the Eie, and uſed with the Eie: When we ſee a man, that was blind, to attaine to learning; wee admire it, and count it extraordinary. The Plow-man, the Mechanick, the Shop-keeper, the Divine, the Lawyer, the Souldier, love all to ſee what they doe: and doe what they ſee in their callings, and learne much by the Eies (if not all) by their bodily ſight, and their Rationall ſight concurring together: Onely the man, that turns the grind-ſtone, may be blind; this is no Art, but a drudgerie rather: the horſes at the water-houſes, being blind, or blind-folded, can doe that worke, to make the wheeles goe round.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for delight, we open thoſe windowes: and view Gods Workes, with Joy: or mens Arts, with a lacritie: or their activeneſſe, motions, geſtures, merrie conceipts, with our ſmiling, laughing, applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rewarding them, which evidences our delight. A Wind-mill, at firſt making, was an admiration, and a delight to the Spectatours: ſo was a Clock, and a pocket-watch: <hi>London</hi> Bridg, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie have beheld with delight; and, when they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine repaired, the Spectatours will have new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: When the inclination within meetes with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table obiect without, and we come to have a proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it, then comes delight in the enioyment.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Concluſions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Have I ſuch ſafetie by the Eies to prevent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie dangers? if I ſee a Cart in a narrow place, I ſtand up, leaſt it hurt mee: if a man come running
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8314:164"/> with a drawne ſword, I flie away from him: if the fire kindle in my houſe, on my ſtuffe, I, ſeeing it, crie out: if the boate be halfe full of water, I will not goe into it, fearing a leake in it. Why ſhould I not uſe my Rationall Sight, which Religion rectifies, and doth not aboliſh? the Rat ſees the baite, but knowes not, it is a trappe: I ſhould looke to the Conſequences of ſinfull-pleaſures, and ſee their danger before hand: the winne is red to the view, but bites as a Serpent in the end; it bites away my Reaſon, my Credit, my peace, my time, my ſilver. The harlot is finely dreſt, ſo is her chamber; but ſhe digs downe a man: <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.26. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does a man, ſpoiles him, conſumes him, infatuates him, and <hi>brings him to a morſell of bread;</hi> this light woman brings him to a heavie curſe; this faire woman brings him to a foule diſeaſe; this ſmiling woman brings him to ſorrow at laſt; it may be, when tis too late.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If my Eies be for the ſafetie of my bodie, much more are GODS Eies for the ſafetie of my bodie, and ſoule. <hi>Except the Lord watch the Citie, the Watch-men watch in vaine:</hi> Except the Lord watch the bodie, the Eies watch in vaine: Gods care is my ſafetie; It is his Eie that is over his people, from one end of the yeare, to the other: <hi>Deutero.</hi> 11.12. Tis GOD preſerves, and defends mee, and <hi>Compaſſes mee about with ſonges of deliverance,</hi> Pſalme 32.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have I ſuch Benefit by my Eies, as to learne to read, write, and worke, and to earne mine owne bread? what ſhall I render to the Lord, for the benefit comes this way? without learning I am like a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall beaſt, without trade, or Art, I am in danger to be like a moyling beaſt. Beggers, that have neither learning, nor trade, nor Art; live moſt wretchedly, without Magiſtracie, or Miniſtrie, or Lawes, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Mariages: I meane the worſer ſort, and their end is without honour.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Let me be wiſe to take heed of ſinfull delights, not to delight at mens deformities, or infirmities, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, or iniquities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be moderate in Lawfull Delights, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the things, the meaſure, and time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To inlarge Spirituall Delights, here no ſurfet, or exceſſe is to be feared.</p>

               <head>Concluſions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. If the Blindman be in danger to fall into the ditch; whether is he like to fall, that is ſpiritually blind? as the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.17. Thoſe, that be naturall men in blindneſſe of mind, are under the power of Satan: <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. From this Blindneſſe, the Lord deliver my Soule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Blind are apt to be deceived, and abuſed; ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8314:165"/> tis with them ſpiritually blind: they doe take errour for truth; paſſion. for zeale; covetouſneſſe, for good husbandrie; falſe Teachers beguile them, weake Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevaile with them: they ſee no great difference betweene Papiſts, and Proteſtants: had they but owle-light, they might diſtinguiſh betweene an Aſſe, and a Lambe: But the Blind eate manie a flie. And doe they ſee that eate their God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Blind is in an uncomfortable eſtate; thoſe ſit in darknes, are in the ſhadow of death: and death is uncomfortable. The Papiſt, that blowes out the light, hath but a bedlam-comfort; and, getting looſe the ſix <hi>Marian</hi> yeares, they made mad worke, and we in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had little Comfort, till they were chained up, and lights ſet up.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <head>Concluſions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. A Doore hath a locke, to make it faſt: ſo ſhould my Mouth be locked faſt with the Feare of GOD, not to be opened to exceſſive eating, and drinking; theſe paſſe-in by the Mouth: nor to be opened to foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh talking, and ieſting, curſing, ſwearing, or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, vaine-boaſting, or mocking; theſe goe out of my Mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:8314:170"/>2. A Doore hath a knocker, which cauſes them within to open: ſo occaſions are ſtill miniſtred to us to open our Mouthes. Queſtions are as ſo manie knockes; wrongs, and Iniuries are hard knockes; and we ſoone open the Doore of our lips, and, it may be, let flie Complainings, curſes, evill wiſhes: and our Doores be not eaſily ſhut againe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Doore hath a bolt, which onely they within can open: this bolt is a wiſe Reſolution. In ſome Caſes, and Companie, ſilence is beſt, though they knocke, yet we ſhould not open: let them looſe their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and our ſilence may be our ſafetie, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Doore ſometimes is onely put-to with a latch, there is neither locke, nor bolt: ſo is the Mouth of a Temporiſer. If a Theefe, or a Bawde, or a Civill man, or a Divine draw the latch, there is entrance: ſo ſome can diſcourſe for errour, or truth; of worldlineſſe, or filthineſſe: the firſt occaſion prevailes, be it whatſoever; there is an eaſie entrance, no locke of the Feare of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As divers Doores being open, we have divers proſpects: ſo tis with the Doore of mens Mouthes. Open a brothel-houſe-doore, you ſee Curtizans, Bawds, light perſons: ſo ſome mens Mouthes once open, wee perceive nothing, but filthie talke, and ſcurrilitie. Open the Beare-garden-Doore, there is confuſion, noiſe, fighting, barking: ſo ſome mens Mouthes are opened with Contention, Railing, Threatning, Cenſuring, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling. Open a Shop-doore, you perceive wares, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: ſo ſome mens Mouthes once open, all the Diſcourſe is for Bargaines, purchaſes, Intereſt-money, engroſſings, getting, ſaving, ſuretiſhip, ſeeuritie, &amp;c. Open ſome Doores, yee ſee pleaſant walkes, ſweet hearbes, bowers, graſplots, trees, fruites: ſo ſome mens Mouthes once open, their talke is wittie, pleaſant,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8314:170"/> profitable, wiſe, harmleſſe, honeſt, ſavourie. Open the Church-Doore, there is Divine Service, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Praiſes, Pſalmes: ſo open ſome mens Mouthes, their talke is Divine, holie, gratious; they praiſe God, and edifie men.</p>

               <p n="6">6. The bones of the Arme are ioyned with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; ſo they grate not one another, nor conſume one another: To teach thoſe ioyned in neareſt bonds a meeke yeelding, and unitie; ſo they may performe Duties comfortably together.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As the Arme hath three Jointes, one at the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, another at the Elbow, another at the Hand: So

               <p>Some bones bee hollow, ſo be ſome Actions, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming more than ſolid; more fained than reall; more in ſhew, than ſubſtance: their hollowneſſe is filled not with marrow, but hypocriſie, deceipt, and ſinne: tis good if theſe were taken out of my Hands, for theſe will bring a myſticall goute, and lameneſſe.</p>
               <p>Some bones be ſtraight, ſo bee ſome Actions: theſe be the moſt perfect, that avoid defect, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and bee even according to the line: ſtraight things be ſtretched out, and the middle agrees with both ends. Let mine Actions have a good riſe, a good aime, and good affections.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Another Opinion; The ſhoes were made of dead Beaſts skinnes: Now he muſt put-off the feare of Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or to put-off the ſhoes, to acknowledge he is not the Head of the Church; he reſignes his right by that Action: that is another Opinion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt put-off his carnall Affections, when hee approches Gods Preſence: this is a true Opinion. The <hi>Iewes</hi> from the Precept, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 19.30. <hi>Yee ſhall Reverence my Sanctuarie,</hi> Concluded, None muſt come there, with ſhoes on his Feete.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To doe his eaſement: wee call it to untruſſe a poynt: The Holie Bible teaches a holie Expreſſion of things unſeemely to be ſpoken: <hi>Adam knew Hevah, Gen.</hi> 4.1. The Title of Pſalme 51. <hi>A Pſalme of David, after he had gone-in to Bath-ſheba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Qu. <hi>What</hi> learne wee from <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. The God of Peace will tread Satan under your Feete?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To encourage them againſt falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, he promiſes them victorie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The God of Peace will deſtroy him, that breaks Peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee muſt not truſt to our owne ſtrength to ſubdue Satan: tis God can doe it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Satan ſhall be ſubdued, and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God did this for the Chriſtians in that time, who ſuffered under the <hi>Roman</hi> Perſecuters.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:8314:195"/>6. As GOD raiſeth up an Adverſarie to the Negligent, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.14. So he threatens to cruſh the greateſt Enemie of the Diligent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When Satan is ſubdued, then Grace floriſhes preſently. The Apoſtle wiſhes the Grace of <hi>Christ,</hi> as ſoone as hee had ſpoken of Satans being troden under our Feete.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Satan the Chiefeſt, then all other Enemies that be Inferiour, muſt needs be ſubdued.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Though Satan hath a Throne for a time, <hi>Revelation</hi> 2.13. Yet hee muſt come under Foote, in a ſhort time: hee ſhall be trod under Foote ſhortly.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thoſe which have trod on Satan, and beene victorious, ſhould encourage us: as <hi>Ioſua</hi> did encourage from former Experience, <hi>Ioſua</hi> 10.24.25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Queſt. <hi>What</hi> is meant by <hi>Eſai</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Daughters</hi> of <hi>Sion</hi> made a tinkling with their Feete?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They had ſome Bells, or Plates, that ſounded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. whatſoever it was, it made a noiſe as they went.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such a noiſe, as they would be taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Queſt. <hi>How</hi> are the Affections like the Feete, and the Feete like the Affections?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Affections be a part of the Soule, and the Feete be a part of the Bodie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Affections be in Motion, ſo be the Feete.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Affections be ſoone cold, ſo be the Feete.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Affections muſt be guided, ſo muſt the Feete.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb facs="tcp:8314:195"/>5. The Affections goe by two, and two: ſo the Feete are in number two.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How doe the Affections goe by two, and two?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There is Joy, and Griefe: Loving, and Hating: Deſiring, and Fearing: Hoping, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Feete, well ſhod with ſhoes, will treade on Stones, or Thornes, yet goe-on Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably: And Affections, well ſhod with Patience, will goe on Croſſes, and Troubles, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the Feete be cold, tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable: ſo when the Affections be cold, tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Stirring, or Fire, warmes the Feete: ſo Duties, and the Ordinances warme the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A paire of little ſhoes will ſerve a paire of little Feete: ſo thoſe which Affect little, a little will content them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. As Children doe grow Elder, ſo their Feete grow bigger, and ſtronger: So GODS Children, as they grow Elder, their Affections ſhould grow better, and ſtronger.</p>
